<h3 align="center">Provides an extremely fast seed project for the development of Angular Universal (SSR) and Electron projects.</h3>

## Goals
Designed to get a team up and running with a fast development toolkit for Angular Universal, Electron, and NativeScript applications.

### Angular Features
- [x] Angular 9 w/ Ivy Renderer
- [x] Platform specific Angular modules.
- [x] Multi Language support.
- [x] Angular PWA support.

### Development Features
- [x] A blazing fast bundler [FuseBox](http://fuse-box.org).
- [x] Production ready builds.
- [x] Angular specific TSLint rules.
- [ ] Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for faster browser reloads during client development.
- [ ] [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), Docker, and Serverless (GC, AWS) Deployment Examples.

### Testing Features
- [x] A blazing fast test runner [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest).
- [x] Angular testing via `jest`
- [x] Server (api/rendering) testing via `supertest` and `jest`
- [ ] E2E testing via `cypress`
- [ ] Electron testing via `spectron`

### Performance Features
- [x] [Brotli compression](https://github.com/google/brotli) with [gzip](http://www.gzip.org) fallback.
- [x] [Ahead-of-Time](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler) (AOT) compilation support.
- [x] [Lazy Loaded + AOT](https://angular-2-training-book.rangle.io/handout/modules/lazy-loading-module.html) modules.

### Universal (SSR) Features
- [x] Flicker-free Angular Universal server built on Express.
- [x] Server prepped to support clustered mode for horizontal scaling via [throng](https://github.com/hunterloftis/throng).
- [x] [HTTP Cache-Tag](https://github.com/flocasts/flo-angular/tree/master/projects/flosportsinc/ng-http-cache-tags) support.
- [x] Unified logging.

### Electron Features
- [x] Main process compiled to bytecode via [bytenode](https://github.com/OsamaAbbas/bytenode) to help protect your source code.
- [x] Configured to ouput windows, mac, and linux builds.

### Caveats
- No CSS preprocessor. Just use plain CSS w/ css-variables.
